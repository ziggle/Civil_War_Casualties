<h1 align="center">Civil War Casualties Project</h1>

<p>This repo contains an rstudio project for gathering casualty data for Generals Lee and Grant during the US Civil War. The data is based on the [jarnord](https://github.com/ziggle/Civil_War_Casualties) Civil War repo and my scraping of general data from the Wikipedia. My goal was to duplicate the analysis of [Bonekemper]{https://www.historynet.com/the-butchers-bill.htm "Butcher's Bill")</p>
