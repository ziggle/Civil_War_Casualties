<h1 align="center">Civil War Casualties Project</h1>

<p>This repo contains an rstudio project for gathering casualty data for Generals Lee and Grant during the US Civil War. The data is based on the <a href="https://github.com/ziggle/Civil_War_Casualties">jarnold's Civil War repo</a> and my scraping of general data from the Wikipedia. My goal was to duplicate the analysis of <a href="https://www.historynet.com/the-butchers-bill.htm">Bonekemper's Butcher's Bill</a></p>
